# MongoDB $inc Operator Error
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the MongoDB `$inc` operator, specifically attempting to increment a field with a non-numeric value. This will cause an error.

The solution shows how to correct the code to increment only numeric fields using the `$inc` operator properly.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numeric fields only, and this is a common error when working with MongoDB updates.
